# MoonlySoftware_InternshipAssignment
 
 
 This is my solution for the internship test assignment for Moonly Software, where I answer the followinfg questions using ReactJs
 
 1. How many orders have been placed?
 2. Who spent the most money?
 3. How much did Mynouk van de Ven spent on 'VIP tickets'?
 4. Collect all the 'Regular' ticket barcodes from orders that have been paid for between 
    14:00:00 2022-05-30 and 14:05:00 2022-05-30 in Europe/Amsterdam timezone.
